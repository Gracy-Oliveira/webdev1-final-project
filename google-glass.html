				<h2>The sensibility of a simple glass</h2>

			<p>Anyone who thinks that to command Google Glass will need a keyboard and a mouse, is mistaken. The device comes with various types of sensors and built-in microphones. So, to give a command, just talk or run your finger on the side of the glasses.</p>
